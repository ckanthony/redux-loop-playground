# redux-loop-playground

Redux-loop-playground is a playground project to understand how [redux-loop](https://github.com/redux-loop) works.

The app calls an api from [reqres.in](https://github.com/benhowdle89/reqres) - special thanks to benhowdle89 for this. - when the frontpage is mounted.  A user's first name is loaded.  The side effect is then managed by redux-loop, an [Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) to Redux.

App scaffolded by [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb)
